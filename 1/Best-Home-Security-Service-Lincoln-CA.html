<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
