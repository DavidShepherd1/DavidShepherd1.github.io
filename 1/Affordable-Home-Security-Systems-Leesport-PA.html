If alarm use led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less robberies across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute substantially to cops ability to collar robbers makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund police reaction to alarmed homes) a ineffective and pricey approach to break-in decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
