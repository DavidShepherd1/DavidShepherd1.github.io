<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also great metal construction.

Must be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
