<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
