<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night.
