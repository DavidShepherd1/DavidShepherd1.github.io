When picking a home security camera is whether you require an outdoor or indoor camera, the other major decision.

<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To connect more cameras to the DVR system, you need additional cable televisions. DVR systems are hard to scale up due to the fact that as soon as every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you need to buy an entirely new DVR prior to adding another camera to the system.

For instance, you can have a clever plug turn on a lamp inside your home or trigger an external siren when the camera finds motion.</p>
