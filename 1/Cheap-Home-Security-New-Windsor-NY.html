<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
