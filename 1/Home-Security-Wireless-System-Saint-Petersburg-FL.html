Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals whenever you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
