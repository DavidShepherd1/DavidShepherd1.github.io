Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you stroll by.
