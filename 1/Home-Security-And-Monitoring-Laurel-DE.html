<p>If you have a larger home or residential or commercial property you wish to keep an eye on, SimpliSafe might be too limited for you. The only outdoor security camera that's presently available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is excellent for watching on visitors and plan shipments, but it leaves other parts of your lawn vulnerable.

However you can connect the Q with other Arlo indoor and outdoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is available for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web internet browser.
