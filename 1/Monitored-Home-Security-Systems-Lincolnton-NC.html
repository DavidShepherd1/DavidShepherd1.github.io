<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be useful for installation. It also makes your camera more tamper-proof since it doesn't have wires that can be cut.

These cameras hold true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is actually excellent. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
