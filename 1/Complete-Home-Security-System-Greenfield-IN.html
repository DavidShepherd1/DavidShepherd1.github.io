<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
