<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the whole family will like. ADT is a household name, so we often try their systems to guarantee they're still up-to-task. In our latest round of testing, we understood that ADT is the most popular provider for a factor.

I hear this all the time in my everyday operations management of American Alarm Systems. If agreement plans do not interest you, consider Blue by ADT, which uses DIY installation and self-monitoring. Some alarm systems use real-time audio and video monitoring technology to confirm the legitimacy of an alarm. In some towns around the United States, this kind of alarm verification allows the residential or commercial property it is safeguarding to be placed on a "confirmed response" list, allowing for quicker and safer authorities responses.</p>

<p>What many individuals do not recognize is that there is another class of security camera that is straight available to the general public, though not discovered in the big box and discount store. These surveillance cameras are classified as "commercial-grade" security cameras and are the kind of camera used by these big box chains to secure their inventory. Look at the ceiling of consumer electronics stores and warehouse chains and you will notice in each aisle a white dome camera that is bigger than the average customer camera. Let that sink in for a moment ... these companies do not even utilize the kind of cameras they are selling to the public, and there is a good reason.</p>
