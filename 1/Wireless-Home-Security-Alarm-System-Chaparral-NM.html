<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>

The alarm does not include a wifi security camera but you can purchase a variety of different Yale cameras that will deal with the alarm as optional extras. There's no external monitoring option with this alarm.</p>

This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
