<h3>Night Vision Security Camera Pleasant Hill CA 94523</h3>
<p>Practically all CCTV camera types from top security camera brand names are capable of HD recording (5MP, 1080p or 4mp), remote access, IR night vision, motion detection and sending push alerts via phone.

Once the cameras were attached, we monitored day and night activities, consisting of the comings and goings of two adults, one kid, and a pet.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
