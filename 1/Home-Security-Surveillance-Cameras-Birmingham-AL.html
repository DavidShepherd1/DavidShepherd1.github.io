The researchers searched for CCTV examinations released between 2007 and 2017 to account for the period because the last evaluation (which covered assessments completed in 2006 and earlier). Techniques included searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV examination research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV evaluations, and contacting leading researchers to ask about forthcoming evaluations.

<p>Cross-zoning is a strategy that does not need a new keypad. Using numerous sensors to monitor activity in one location, software analyses input from all the sources.
