<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies every time you walk by.
