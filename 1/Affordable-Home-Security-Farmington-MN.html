<p>Pelco provides video surveillance cameras and video management options for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping hotels, centers, and others. IP cameras work by using an IP (IP represents web procedure) network, typically the exact same information network the rest of a company uses. A different network utilizing category 5 circuitry can be utilized if bandwidth is an issue. In either case, video info is tape-recorded on a server, which means video data can be found on site or in a remote area. After screening, we sent each of our top picks, along with the Wyze Cam v2, to Expense McKinley, head of info security at The New York Times (Wirecutter's parent company), for hack screening. (Bill is also a self-proclaimed paranoid infosec person.") He evaluated each camera for any impressive security flaws and concluded that all of our top choices and the budget Wyze Web cam passed basic security standards and protections.</p>
<p>No false alarm penalties: Homeowners with a self-monitored system are less most likely to dispatch the cops for an incorrect alarm.

If  police are contacted for a false alarm, property owners might need to pay a fine for dispatching cops needlessly. A self-monitored home limits the capacity for subsequent charges and false alarms.</p>
