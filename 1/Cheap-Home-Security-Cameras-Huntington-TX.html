<p>Sensing units permit cameras to begin and stop recording based on time or motion detection. The one time where lag does end up being a little an issue is between spotting and tape-recording movement. Because the Pro 2 does not do continuous video recording, it takes a second for the camera to actually turn on when it spots motion. They could get past the camera before it had time to tape-record them if a nefarious lawbreaker was quickly enough. Mobile phone can also now be used to from another location set and unset alarms by means of apps.</p>
<p>The Hive View delivers fantastic 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting.

<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we evaluated, and it uses two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our screening. The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And in spite of having an attractive cost and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that includes $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>
