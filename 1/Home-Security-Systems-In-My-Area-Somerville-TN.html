<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Available. ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Ring for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small cost. Due to the fact that it comes with multiple door and window sensors for full coverage, we suggest the eight-piece package. We also suggest including a doorbell video camera eventually. The upfront cost of wireless security systems can be costly. Factor in the upfront cost of the control board, activation charges, monitoring fees and all equipment.

As with their indoor counterparts, outdoor cameras link to your Wi-Fi network and enable you to view live video from your phone.

Tech is supposed to make our lives much easier and Hive's community measures up to that. It's all the function with no frustration.</p>
