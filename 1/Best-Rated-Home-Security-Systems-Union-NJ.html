As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "understanding that you are being watched by armed federal government agents tends to deter things. You don't want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself."

They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, hookers or druggies." Undoubtedly, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that individuals deemed to be "out of time and location" with the surroundings underwent extended surveillance.</p>
