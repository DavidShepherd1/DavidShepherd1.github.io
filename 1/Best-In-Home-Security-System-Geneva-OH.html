<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the store.

<p>Another important subject to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend just how much is enough. In this article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The exact same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much picture information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some tricky repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
