<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
