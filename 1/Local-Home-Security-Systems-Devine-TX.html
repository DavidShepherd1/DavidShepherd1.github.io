<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical considering that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
