<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests potential wrongdoers are less likely to commit criminal offense if they believe they are being watched or have a higher threat of being captured.

CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense prevention strategy, which argues that opportunities to anger can be lowered by altering a variety of systems such as increasing the threat of a culprit being captured, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal offense, reducing benefits from criminal offense commission, and decreasing justifications that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This indicates that the culprit needs to know the added surveillance for it to attain its wanted effect.</p>

For the ones that don't, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, nothing is taped. The systems with video storage normally consist of either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage option saves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself. This alternative is normally cost-free. A cloud storage option conserves your video clips in the cloud.
