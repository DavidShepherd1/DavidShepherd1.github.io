<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level.
