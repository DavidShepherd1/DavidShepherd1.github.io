<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment this way to make clients stick with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies indicates hundreds of dollars down the drain and a huge headache for consumers. How did they do it? They put 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their latest software application and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't say which device was the very first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
<p>ADT's monitoring centers supply protection with the current technological equipment 24 hr a day, 365 days a year. ADT engineers check the company's cameras, entranceway contacts, high-decibel alarms, and smoke alarms under tough conditions-including severe cold and heat, in addition to circumstances where there may be radio disturbance.

<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our testing-- during the day and during the night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video.
