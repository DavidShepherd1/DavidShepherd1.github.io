<p>Three huge advantages of wireless security systems for occupants are their impermanence, expandability and mobility. Tenants, unlike property owners, typically prevent making permanent changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and setting up irreversible electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entranceways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensors and other parts can easily be established at different residential or commercial properties later on, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new elements too. Wireless security plans also enable push-button control of the system and general home automation.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
