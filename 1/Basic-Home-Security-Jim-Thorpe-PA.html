<p>With Lorex security camera systems you get completely featured, professional-grade security services that are easy to install and simple to utilize. Honeywell Total Link cameras represent the next generation of residential video surveillance equipment. These portable cameras utilize motion-sensing innovation that prompts them to begin recording whenever the sensors identify movement.

Just a couple decades earlier, the home security market was controlled by a few huge names providing costly, rigid plans with little versatility and unfriendly, long-lasting agreements.

Additionally, the shape of the camera is ideal for focusing on a set field, such as an entry or exit, but needs multiple cameras if a user needs to see multiple fixed views.
