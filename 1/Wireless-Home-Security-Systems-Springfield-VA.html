<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.

Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
