Your monitoring company will get the alert and then alert the authorities for you when something activates your alarm. Seems like a more secure bet to us.</p>

Both are similarly prone to incorrect alarms, so it depends upon your individual preference. Quickly pair with Ring Video Doorbells and Ring Security Cams, Alexa-enabled devices and third-party alarm devices for one complete system.</p>
