It simply does not add up. To offer such low prices, makers must cut corners, and the end outcome is compromised efficiency. What good is a surveillance camera that just works preferably in best conditions like brilliant sunshine? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in specific scenarios such as baby-sitter webcams or checking in on a pet, though when aiming to gather proof of a crime they typically lose.</p>
