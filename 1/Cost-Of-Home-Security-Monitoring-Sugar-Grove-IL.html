Renters, unlike house owners, usually avoid making permanent modifications to their homes.

On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensing units and other parts can easily be established at various properties later, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new components too.

For example, you can have a smart plug turn on a light inside or activate an external siren when the camera detects motion.</p>
