<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
