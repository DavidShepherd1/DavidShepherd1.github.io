<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a short explanation of how thermal cameras work: All items produce infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy released by an object is referred to as its heat signature. In general, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it produces. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that is capable of finding tiny differences in temperature level. The device collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and creates an electronic image based on details about the temperature level differences. Because things are rarely specifically the very same temperature as other items around them, a thermal camera can identify them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>
