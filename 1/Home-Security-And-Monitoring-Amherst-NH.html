<p>As an inducement to buy an alarm system, a number of companies offer "complimentary monitoring services" for the first few months. Many insurer offer discount rates on insurance premiums to clients with operable alarm systems.

The offers of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers cast doubt on the appropriateness of the present trend in U.S. policing of permitting three or 4 totally free false alarms per fiscal year, since they supply no up-front incentives to encourage owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>
