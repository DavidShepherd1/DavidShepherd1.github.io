As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
