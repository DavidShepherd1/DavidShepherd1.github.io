<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
