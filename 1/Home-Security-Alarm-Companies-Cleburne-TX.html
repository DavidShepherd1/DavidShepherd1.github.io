<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for one of our top areas. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape-record as much as 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were frequently missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline. With standard wise home devices like automatic door locks, you can remain in bed and check that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you look out for would-be plan burglars or talk with visitors who stop by.</p>
