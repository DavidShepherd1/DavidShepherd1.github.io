When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

<h3>Best Home Security Packages in Illinois</h3>
<p>Among IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video from anywhere. A common misconception is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free.

Lastly, wire-free cameras are entirely cable complimentary and battery powered.
