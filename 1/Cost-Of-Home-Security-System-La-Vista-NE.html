<h3>Wireless Security System in La Vista NE</h3>
<p>This self monitored alarm has four smart modes-- Home, Away, Night, and Personal. Based upon that, the camera switches on or off depending on your location. The camera records 1080p videos with a 147-degree large angle lens that minimizes all blind areas and provides you access to a larger field of vision than a lot of cameras. It is also geared up with a 3x digital zoom function that allows you to focus and capture information such as facial functions in case of burglaries.</p>
<p>The Hive View delivers terrific 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting. Considering that this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to manually stop alerts (and recording, considering that it does that even when alerts are off). We also experienced above-average connection concerns, with two Hive test systems disconnecting eight times over two months.
