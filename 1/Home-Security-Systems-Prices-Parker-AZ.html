The alarm is just one of 2 we checked that includes an external siren, and we're impressed that it likewise features a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, further dissuading anybody from trying to break in to your residential or commercial property. We evaluated Somfy's more costly system, which included a wifi security camera, but more budget-friendly packages are likewise readily available.
