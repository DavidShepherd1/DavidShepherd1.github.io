If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer break-ins across a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute significantly to authorities capability to nab intruders makes the underwriting of alarm response by authorities and entire communities (all taxpayers fund authorities response to alarmed properties) a expensive and ineffective  method to robbery decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
