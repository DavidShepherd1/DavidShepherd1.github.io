<p>Motion sensing units use backup protection in case a burglar handles to get into your home. But they only run when you run out the house.

Because they have bigger internal video sensing units and higher-quality parts that can adjust and capture outstanding low light video, commercial cameras exceed their more affordable cousins.</p>

<p>Keypad: A mobile phone app is a need to for usage when you're far from home, but you should not have to fumble with your phone when you're going and coming. A keypad can sit by the front door, making it easy to arm and deactivate the system.
