<p>Outdoor Camera - This weatherproof camera provides smooth security video with a combination of tough electrical wiring and WiFi. It's motion-activated and has a speaker system, letting you send out voice warnings through your phone. The lens covers 140 degrees and lets you focus on the action. Like the Ping camera, the Vivint Outdoor Camera records 20-second clips. After we utilized the Anker EufyCam for nearly six months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to deliver on its promise of as much as one year of battery life. What we don't love is that it leaves gaps in between recordings, which varied anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending upon the settings. We have actually seen some improvements given that the camera's launch, and will continue to evaluate and upgrade this evaluation, as needed.</p>

<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we evaluated, and it provides two-way interaction with its paid Canary Subscription. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our testing. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And regardless of having an attractive cost and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>
<p>Brinks has quite basic equipment, but we like its wise monitoring alerts. It features HD live streaming, motion informs, night vision, a decent app and, best of all, 14 days of free motion-based cloud storage. This Wyze camera also includes a built-in microSD card if you want to go the local storage path.

<p>The Nest Camera IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the very same membership design and same app as the initial Nest Camera Outdoor, but it includes more-detailed person detection, a brighter image, an automatic close-up tracking feature (which follows a person around the viewing location), better audio, a more powerful mount, and a wider operating temperature level range (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit). It's likewise more tamper-proof than any of our other choices, but that added security makes for a more difficult installation process, and it costs practically two times the cost of the Nest Camera Outdoor.</p>
