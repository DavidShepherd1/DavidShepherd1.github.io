<p>We downloaded each camera's app to an iPhone 7, an iPad, and a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie, when possible. The cameras spent weeks protecting our front door, notifying us to pals, member of the family, delivery people, and even the milkman. When we got a good enough take a look at those friendly faces, we tilted the whole collection external for another two weeks to see what kind of outcomes we would get when the cameras dealt with your house throughout the street, which is around 50 feet away.</p>
