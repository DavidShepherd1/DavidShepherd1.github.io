<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally referred to as shock sensors, are different because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
