The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be touchy, with terrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our system was malfunctioning, therefore we might revisit this review. Basically, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last five days of footage to the cloud.
