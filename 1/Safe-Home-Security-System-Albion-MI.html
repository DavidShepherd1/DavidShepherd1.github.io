<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we checked, and it offers two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership.

The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And despite having an appealing price and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>

<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood should take on a share of the cost. If alarm use led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms caused much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer thefts across a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute significantly to police capability to nab burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and whole communities (all taxpayers fund cops action to alarmed properties) a inefficient and pricey method to burglary reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
