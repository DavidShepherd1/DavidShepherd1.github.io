We love that the system includes a wifi security camera and only informs you when motion is developed by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (guaranteeing there's no false signals). However, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have been activated.
