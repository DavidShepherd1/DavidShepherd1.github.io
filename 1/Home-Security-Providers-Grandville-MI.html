<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the very same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much wider area and for that reason offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal because the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers recognize that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
