<p>Since we know all the ins and outs of Ring Alarm, we suggest the 8-piece security set as the very best way to make the most of Ring's budget-friendly home security alternatives.

More technical in nature, IP camera systems will likely take more proficiency to setup, and typically cost more than analog cameras. All detectors and sensors interact with a control panel. These are available in two forms: they can be a physical panel that's set up within the home on a wall, or a virtual panel that's available and regulated through smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p>Depending on the size, these can be anywhere from a rifle bullet or a lipstick tube to a bread loaf, however the basic gist is the same in every case.

As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a regular self-monitored system can do like set off a camera to record or set off the siren. Read our evaluation here.</p>
