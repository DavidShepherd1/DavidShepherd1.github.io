During our hands-on screening of Brinks, we discovered the systems to be rather simple to establish and utilize-- however not rather as easy as brand names like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm.</p>
<p>Cameras are a wise addition to a new or existing home security system, but they do not replace the requirement for alarms and sensing units.

House owners pay for a security system to be professionally monitored. There's a month-to-month monitoring fee that normally varies between $15-40 a month.</p>
