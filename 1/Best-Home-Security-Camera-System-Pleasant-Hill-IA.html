<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers recognize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
