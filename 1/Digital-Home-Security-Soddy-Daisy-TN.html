<p>Samsung SmartThings is one of the most personalized self monitored alarm because you get to choose which devices and sensing units you want (and how many), and which you do not.

<p>It would be easy to roll your eyes at this last point, but it suggests you can ask your home security camera for the weather report - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will respond. It also suggests that if you actually saw a burglar riffle through your home, you might quickly tape-record a message to him or her through your mobile phone, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you think of, would suffice to send out even the most committed career criminal scampering empty-handed down the road.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
