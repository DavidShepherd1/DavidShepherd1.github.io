<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is definitely something to be taken into consideration.

<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs every time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
