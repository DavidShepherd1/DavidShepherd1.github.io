<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the entire family will love. How much bandwidth your camera uses depends on numerous aspects. Some of the considerations include image resolution and whether your camera records whatever or just clips set off by motion or sound. Home security systems are a one-time financial investment that can settle, big time, down the line. Does the best system have all the bells and whistles, from facial acknowledgment to floodlights?
