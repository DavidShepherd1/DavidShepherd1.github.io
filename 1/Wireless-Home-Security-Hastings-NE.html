<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
