<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we checked, and it provides two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription.

The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And regardless of having an appealing cost and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>
