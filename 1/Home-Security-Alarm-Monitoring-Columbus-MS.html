<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is an excellent security camera and a remarkable value.

The camera features a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save video footage locally on an SD card.
