<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound changes to the character of our public spaces. When citizens are being seen by the authorities - or mindful they might be enjoyed at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has explained, "knowing that you are being viewed by armed federal government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You do not want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals may learn to be careful about the books and periodicals they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm hidden observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, members or druggies." Undoubtedly, the research studies of cameras in Britain found that individuals deemed to be "out of time and location" with the surroundings were subjected to extended surveillance.</p>
