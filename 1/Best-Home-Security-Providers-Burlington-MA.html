<p>Dependability has long been at the heart of the argument over wireless versus hardwired home security systems. It's an argument that's typically skewed by aspects such as apprehension over the susceptibility of wireless systems, consisting of disturbance from radio signals and problems that cause false alarms.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
