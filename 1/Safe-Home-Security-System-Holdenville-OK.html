<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>

We've seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>
