Another area where Arlo stands out is customer service. After long-term screening this camera since we first made it a choice in 2016, we noticed that our Arlo Q began projecting a pink tint, which appears to be an ongoing problem for some owners. We called consumer support, which offered a complimentary replacement system-- even though the warranty had actually long considering that ended.</p>

When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.
