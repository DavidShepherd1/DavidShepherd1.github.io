When people are being seen by the authorities - or conscious they may be watched at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually explained, "understanding that you are being enjoyed by armed government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You do not wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "individuals might find out to be mindful about the regulars and books they read in public, preventing titles that may alarm hidden observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang hookers, drug addicts or members."
