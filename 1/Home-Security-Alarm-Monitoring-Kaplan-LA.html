<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>

<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complex than it should be. Recordings, signals, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
