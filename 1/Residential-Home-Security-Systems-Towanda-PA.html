<p>It's all find and dandy to desire a security camera all over in the home, however sometimes you just one that stands alone. That's where the Logitech Circle 2 can be found in, with its Alexa and Google Assistant combination, along with Night Vision, two-way talk, and complimentary storage for the last 24 hr of video.
