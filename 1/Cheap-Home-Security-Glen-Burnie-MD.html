<p>Power-over-Ethernet switches apply just to NVR systems, but they eliminated other elements that would be essential for a DVR system, like additional power sources and the BNC cable televisions used to link cameras to the DVR.

<p>CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a terrific security camera and an extraordinary worth. It receives an Exceptional score for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests.
