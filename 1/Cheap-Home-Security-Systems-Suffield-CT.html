<p>If a staff member (relied on entity) generates a wireless router and plugs it into an unsecured switchport, the whole network can be exposed to anyone within range of the signals.

However, there are effective countermeasures (like disabling open switchports throughout switch setup and VLAN configuration to restrict network access) that are readily available to protect both the network and the information it contains, however such countermeasures need to be applied evenly to all network gadgets.</p>
