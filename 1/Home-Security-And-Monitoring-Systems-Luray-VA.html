<h3>Best Home Security System Company in Virginia</h3>
<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complex than it should be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>Dome Cameras - vandal-proof and discrete cameras with a larger viewing angle, perfect for inside or outside your home. Increasing deployment of voice over IP innovation (VoIP) is driving the adoption of broadband signaling for alarm reporting. Numerous websites requiring alarm installations no longer have conventional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with traditional telephone dialer capability do not work dependably over some types of VoIP service.

These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of the box. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is actually great.
