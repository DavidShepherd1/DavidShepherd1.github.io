<p>The SimpliSafe equipment is now in its third variation, with an easier and more elegant style for both app and devices. The base station is curvier and the sensing units are smaller sized, but the range is better, appealing connections to wireless sensors approximately 800 feet away. We didn't go that far, however we had the ability to set about 40 feet in different instructions, through walls to locations in the cooking area and dining-room. No complex hardware such as a digital video recorder (DVR) is needed on-site. To see your facility in real-time and review recent occasions, all you require is a password.

<p>Another method to keep recordings on a non-analogue media is through using a digital video recorder (DVR).

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
