<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
