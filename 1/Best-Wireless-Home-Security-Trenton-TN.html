<p>Security: There have actually been lots of headlines about hackers compromising home cameras, infant screens, and other Wi-Fi gadgets to spy on people, so make certain to examine what steps has each maker taken to remove this problem. Try to find a camera that supports updated wireless security procedures, such as WPA2, and ensure it encrypts internet transmission of your user name, your password, and the live feeds.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
