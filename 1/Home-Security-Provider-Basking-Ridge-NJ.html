Nevertheless, to save that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink doesn't give you geofencing or two-way interaction, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker locations. To recoup costs and hold alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company rather of with you.
