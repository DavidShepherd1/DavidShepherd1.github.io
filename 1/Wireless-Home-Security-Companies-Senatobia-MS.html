<p>The security systems I have actually created and executed are strictly for monitoring activity of a prospective target, whether from a terrorist hazard or area burglars or vandals. The systems are deployed for the protection of lives and home and not to watch people as they jaywalk across the street or run a red light (which both are, by the method, versus the law).

<p>Frequently a wired system can be confused with local alarms. However, the two are drastically different. The primary distinction is that the wired system pairs with the other smart home devices to produce a network of home security around your home. It can be controlled remotely through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile device or through the control panel (also called the alarm panel). A local system does not have the capability to pair with other wise devices and can not be managed from another location. Also a local alarm won't call the authorities; it merely triggers an audible siren to inform people close by.</p>
