<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
