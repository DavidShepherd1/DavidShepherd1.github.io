As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being watched by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You don't wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he alerts, "people might find out to be mindful about the periodicals and books they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers.
