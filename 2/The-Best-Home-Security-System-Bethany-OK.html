<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>

<p>In addition to this phase of the growth, a main command center was built to house a new security office with a CCTV control console for several CRT monitors to view the cameras and a new model keyboard with a built-in joystick to gain access to and manage the new PTZ cameras. Reception - Most reception areas in a business will be extremely trafficked, therefore a perfect place for a camera installation.

When the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped.
