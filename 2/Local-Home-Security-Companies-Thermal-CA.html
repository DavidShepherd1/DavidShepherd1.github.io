<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
