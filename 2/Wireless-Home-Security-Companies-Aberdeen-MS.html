For beginners, it looks gorgeous: the all-white style and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily similar to the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). It's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you might call to mind when you envision a home security camera.</p>

<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had set up on the porch by a certified electrical expert (who takes place to be my hubby). All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>

They can track an individual or a vehicle across a range, or be configured to cycle through various orientations to give you a much more detailed field of view with a single piece of hardware.
