<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and might even trigger false alarms. Incorrect alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the authorities if they occur regularly enough. Another possible drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool must be changed or charged routinely in order to keep the system working.
