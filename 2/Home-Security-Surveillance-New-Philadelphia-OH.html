<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
