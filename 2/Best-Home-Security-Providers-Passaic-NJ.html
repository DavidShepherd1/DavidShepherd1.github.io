We have actually been evaluating Ring Alarm a fair bit recently, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security kit that offers basic intrusion protection with super-low month-to-month monitoring costs. Or ... no monitoring costs at all if you choose the free self-monitor" alternative.</p>

Such a gadget is comparable in performance to a PC with a capture card and suitable video recording software application Unlike PCs, many DVRs developed for CCTV functions are embedded devices that need less maintenance and easier setup than a PC-based solution, for a medium to a a great deal of analogue cameras.

The Angee is low on features and big on running expenses. The Ooma Butterfleye has no night vision and has poor daytime video; the Reolink C1 Pro often displayed pink and green lines throughout the screen; the Yi Dome Camera constantly flickered at night; and the Samsung SmartCam had bad audio and a confusing app.</p>
