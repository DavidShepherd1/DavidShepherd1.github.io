<p>You might think you'll never ever be targeted, however why take the possibility? An estimated 2,000,000 robberies take place in the United States every year. Theft avoidance is a needed safety measure to make sure the safety of your possessions. An alarm system can serve a number of functions to this end. In some cases, its existence can serve as a deterrent-- intruders are less apt to target a spot where it is more likely that they will come across such disturbance. In other circumstances, when they go through with the act, the alarm can serve to alert individuals in the area (in addition to the authorities) that something is wrong. This ensures a quick reaction and decreases the burglar's possibilities of success.</p>
<p>Dome Cameras - vandal-proof and discrete cameras with a broader watching angle, ideal for inside or outside your home. Increasing deployment of voice over IP innovation (VoIP) is driving the adoption of broadband signaling for alarm reporting.

<p>Keypad: A smart device app is a must for use when you're far from home, but you shouldn't have to fumble with your phone when you're going and coming.
