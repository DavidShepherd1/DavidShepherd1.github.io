<p>Various types of CCTV cameras. While burglar alarm innovation has developed substantially given that the 19th century, it is still based on the basic concepts innovated by Augustus Pope and Alexander Bell. All significant alarm companies, including Mijac Alarm, make use of proximity sensors in the windows and doors as the very first line of defense against possible burglars, and alarm transfer information to a central monitoring station that can dispatch law enforcement rapidly and effectively.</p>
<p>One of the very first decisions that you'll need to make is if you need a wireless or wired security camera system, and the correct answer most likely depends on where you intend to put the parts and cameras.
