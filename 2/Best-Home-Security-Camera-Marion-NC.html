<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, many burglar alarms work the specific same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut.
