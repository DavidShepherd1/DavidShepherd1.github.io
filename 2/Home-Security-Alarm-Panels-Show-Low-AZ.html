Still, what you get for the money is all the typical Arlo traits in regards to the strong develop quality, superb camera video footage, tons of creative features and a polished app.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
