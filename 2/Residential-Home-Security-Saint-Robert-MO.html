Catastrophe protection - you can link a z-wave smoke and carbon monoxide alarm to the app. Downside: some systems have a high rate of incorrect alarms due to the fact that some of these sensing units may be too delicate.

Better outdoor lighting also suggests a clearer video for any outside cameras you have. When choosing flood lights, think about the brightness and distance the light shines. Flood lights can hinder vandals or frighten them away, however as a single tool, they are more for your assurance than for home protection.</p>
