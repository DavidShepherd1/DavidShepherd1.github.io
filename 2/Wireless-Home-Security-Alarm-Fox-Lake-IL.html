<p>This clever clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device.

We like that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For a lot of homes, you'll require several Minuts throughout your home, which can get expensive.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
