<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter occasion notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes.
