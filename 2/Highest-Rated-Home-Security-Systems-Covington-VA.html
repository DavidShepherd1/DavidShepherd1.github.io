<p>Pelco offers video surveillance cameras and video management services for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping hotels, others, and centers. IP cameras work by utilizing an IP (IP stands for web protocol) network, often the exact same data network the rest of a company uses.

A few models use batteries, making placement more versatile, however this requires other trade-offs, which we highlight in the Competitors section. Wi-Fi coverage also impacts where you place a camera: If you want to put a camera in an area that doesn't get a good Wi-Fi signal, think about updating your router or adding an extender or repeater. (For a take a look at our networking picks, see our guides to The very best Wi-Fi Router (for Most People)" and The Very Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good guideline that if your smart device or laptop computer gets good Wi-Fi reception in the location you want to mount the camera, you likely won't have an issue.</p>
<p>One example of SimpliSafe's high quality is their SmashSafe backup against tampering: If someone tries to disable your system, the monitoring service will inform cops.
