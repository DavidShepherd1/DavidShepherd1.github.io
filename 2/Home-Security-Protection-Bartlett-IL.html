PoE switches are likewise normally considered a more secure method to send information.</p>
<p>IP cameras are much higher resolution, enabling audio and video surveillance to be sent over a network, with IP addresses designated to each camera. More technical in nature, IP camera systems will likely take more knowledge to setup, and generally cost more than analog cameras. All sensors and detectors interact with a control panel.
