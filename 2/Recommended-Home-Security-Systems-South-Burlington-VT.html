When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.

Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
