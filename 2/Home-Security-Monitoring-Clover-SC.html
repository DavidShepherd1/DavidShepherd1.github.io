<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to make every effort to make a camera with the most tough setup known to male. Here's how it plays out: First you need to download the app and put in your e-mail address. Then you go into the WiFi information of the network you're trying to link to. Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic sound wave to the camera to send the WiFi information. (You need to play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, dogs wail, cats scream, babies sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the very same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider area and for that reason offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by method of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
