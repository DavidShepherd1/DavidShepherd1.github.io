CCTV are extensively used by the federal government in addition to private organizations, to prevent or decrease possible security risks. The boost in the demand for CCTV ultimately increases the need for the CCTV tester.

Let that sink in for a moment ... these companies do not even use the kind of cameras they are offering to the general public, and there is a good reason why.</p>
