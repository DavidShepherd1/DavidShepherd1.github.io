For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment this way to make clients stick with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies suggests numerous dollars down the drain and a big headache for clients. How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their newest software application and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day.
