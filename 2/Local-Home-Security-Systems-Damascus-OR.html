The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>

This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
