Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal because the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level.
