<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security specialists investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for one of our top spots. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape up to 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were typically missing, despite showing up in the app's activity timeline.

<p>This clever clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device.

We love that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll require numerous Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get pricey. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it only keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.
