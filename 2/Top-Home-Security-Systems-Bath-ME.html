<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients recognize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
