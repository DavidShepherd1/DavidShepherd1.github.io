<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment by doing this to make consumers stick with them longer, since switching monitoring companies indicates hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for customers. How did they do it? They put 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their latest software application and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't say which gadget was the very first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
<p>Essentially, a wireless security system is comprised of alarms, sensors, cameras, and different detectors all linked to a main control board by means of radio signals. For instance, a four-camera system that runs 24 hr a day utilizing IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would need 2.79 terabytes of storage space for video, according to the Supercircuits calculator.</p>

<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. When it detected any type of disturbance, SimpliSafe reacted with a statement saying the system would notify users. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be a perfect storm of circumstances for someone to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to duplicate the problem. Although our screening should not be taken as definitive, our company believe this problem is unlikely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe clients who own the current system.</p>
<p>The system is doing not have in only two areas-- security add-ons and smart home add-ons-- where it ranks Good and Fair, respectively, because you can't expand the system with as lots of extra security and wise home devices as contending systems.
