We actually took pleasure in using Brinks' video functions, and we like how their top-tier package comes with an HD video doorbell for good measure.</p>

If it's compatible and fairly contemporary-- you can keep the equipment you already own rather than buy a totally new system, the advantage is that--.

<p>We do not conceal equipment costs by rolling them into a high monthly rate.
