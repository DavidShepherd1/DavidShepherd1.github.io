<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
