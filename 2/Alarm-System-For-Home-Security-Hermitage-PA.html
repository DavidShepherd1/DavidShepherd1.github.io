Hello Rebeca, thanks for this blog.

After reading the comments on this page I went to Armorax's website to see what they offered; they have actually partnered with another security company and their starter plan I think starts at $0 down. The panel and sensors are Qolsys, so that's good. Monitoring is priced well too, so overall a lot.</p>

Depending upon the lens' field of view, it can see between 100 and 180 degrees. That's a big range in regards to the camera's vision cone. You need to consider a camera with an extremely large field of view if you desire to view a large area. The ability to mechanically tilt the camera and pan is a great asset too.</p>

Generally, consumer-grade cameras are built to work well when there is lots of readily available light, and once the lighting becomes low or missing (believe sundown or nighttime), their pedigree starts to reveal. Commercial cameras exceed their less expensive cousins because they have bigger internal video sensing units and higher-quality components that can adjust and capture outstanding low light video.</p>
