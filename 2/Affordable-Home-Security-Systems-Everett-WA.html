<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Offered. ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Sound for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small cost. We advise the eight-piece package due to the fact that it features multiple windows and door sensing units for complete protection. We also recommend adding a doorbell video camera at some point.

Sure, you get a lower rate if you go with a three-year contract, however considering that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a big commitment.

<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and absolutely enjoy it. Terrific clearness. I wished to set up viewing on my cell phone but had a couple concerns that the tech answered with ease. I Would certainly buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely suggest this company.
