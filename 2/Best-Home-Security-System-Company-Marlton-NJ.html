<p>Beyond the scope of protecting a business from theft and vandalism is the monetary protection that a security system provides.

For all the more basic smarts, it's terrific, though. If you do not currently have an Arlo camera or 2 in place, you're going to require to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all link to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can imply there are range concerns.</p>

With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
