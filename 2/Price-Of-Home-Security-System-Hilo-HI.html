<p>Considering that the glass housing does not get in the way, they aren't quite as vandal-proof as dome cameras, however they make up for it in capabilities. As well as being fantastic for re-positioning on the fly, they are better for low-light and infrared since the glass housing does not impede the lens. With some, it's tough to tell at a glimpse where they've been aimed, so they can offer a panoptic impression as a deterrent, despite their true field of view. Setting up a video surveillance system with a few of these is a great alternative for a number of different setups.</p>
