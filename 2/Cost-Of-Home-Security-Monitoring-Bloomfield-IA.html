<p>Nearly 100 surveillance cameras-- 24 PTZ cameras, 17 dome cameras, and 54 license acknowledgment cameras are being set up on 64 power poles in Birmingham, Alabama. The cameras will be monitored by the Jefferson County Metro Area Crime Center The license plate recognition camera information will be uploaded to the FBI's Crook Justice Information Services, and the city will get the content from the FBI's website. Although a proposed ordinance needing all facilities with alcohol licenses to install cameras that feed into the monitoring center was abandoned in the face of opposition, several bars implicated of breaking liquor laws have gone into authorization decrees with the city's Alcohol Control board, needing them to do just that.</p>
<p>Numerous home security systems are controlled by smart devices and that pattern will continue. Systems will have less wall-mounted keypads, and instead, provide more controls to more gadgets. Wireless door, window, glass break, freeze, water and motion sensing units interact with a center or base station in your house. The primary control should be centrally located in your home and have full time non-switched Air Conditioning power. Wired alarm systems are incredibly trustworthy and you do not need to stress over their battery running out. However, they are fixed in location, may need expert installation, and they're not portable.</p>
