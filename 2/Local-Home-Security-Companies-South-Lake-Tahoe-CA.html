<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the specific same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical present.

If somebody were to unlock that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
