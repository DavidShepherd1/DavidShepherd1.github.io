<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for one of our top spots. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can record as much as 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were typically missing, despite appearing in the app's activity timeline.

If intruders can not see any security cameras, they may also be less cautious about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>
