As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical given that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
