The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to deal with information after the truth, which suggests that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it likewise brings with it some downsides. 4K images are huge and use up a great deal of tape-recording storage space.
