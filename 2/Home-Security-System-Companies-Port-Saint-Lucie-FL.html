<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring extensive but subtle modifications to the character of our public areas. When people are being watched by the authorities - or aware they may be enjoyed at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "understanding that you are being seen by armed government agents tends to deter things. You do not wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "people might learn to be mindful about the books and periodicals they check out in public, preventing titles that might alarm unseen observers. They might also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, druggies or members." Certainly, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that individuals deemed to be "out of time and place" with the environments were subjected to extended surveillance.</p>

Hiding a camera within a frame, clock, sprinkler head, or smoke alarm might make a reception security camera more effective, but be sure to check with state laws concerning the legality of a hidden camera prior to doing so.</p>
<p>The second wireless function pertains to how your security system communicates with the alarm monitoring station. Older security systems would use a home phone line to dial out" and communicate with the alarm monitoring station. Nevertheless, lots of households no longer utilize a phone line in their home. So, how do we get your alarm to communicate with the monitoring station? Much in the very same way you do - we can link via the web or by means of a wireless cell phone signal.</p>
