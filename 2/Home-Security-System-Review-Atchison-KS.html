<p>The real factor cameras are typically deployed is to decrease much pettier criminal activities. But it has not even been demonstrated that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been extensively released in public locations, sociologists studying the issue have actually found that they have not decreased crime. "When the crime and offence figures were gotten used to appraise the basic down trend in crimes and offenses," criminologists found in one study, "reductions were noted in certain categories however there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had decreased criminal activity overall in the city centre."
