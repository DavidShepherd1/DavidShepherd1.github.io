When it discovered any type of interference, SimpliSafe reacted with a statement stating the system would notify users. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be an ideal storm of scenarios for somebody to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to replicate the problem. Although our testing should not be taken as conclusive, we believe this problem is not likely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe consumers who own the existing system.</p>

Finally, wire-free cameras are totally cable free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are essential, these are the simplest alternative to install and all of the tape-recorded footage is stored in the cloud.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.
