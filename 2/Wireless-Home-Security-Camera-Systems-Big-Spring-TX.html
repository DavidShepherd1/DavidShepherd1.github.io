(You must play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, canines howl, felines squeal, infants cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It doesn't work. And it never works.</p>

We need to note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the photo quality based on available bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day.
