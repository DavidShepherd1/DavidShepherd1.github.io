<p>Various kinds of CCTV cameras.

All major alarm companies, consisting of Mijac Alarm, utilize proximity sensing units in the doors and windows as the very first line of defense versus possible burglars, and alarm systems transfer info to a central monitoring station that can dispatch police quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>When hiring an alarm or home security company, check to see if your state requires them to be licensed. Many states have license requirements for alarm company. You can inspect the Angie's List Licensing Tool to see if your state requires licenses for home security companies.

(The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However considering that the majority of retail theft would not journey an alarm anyway (a staff member slipping some extra cash while offering a consumer change, for instance), we think it's more vital to have high-quality images so you have the evidence you need.

<p>The Canary is among the largest cameras we tested, and it provides two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our testing. The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And despite having an attractive rate and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that includes $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>

<p>The City does not refund license charges to alarm-monitoring companies when customers cancel their service. Private alarm companies may have their own policies concerning refunds.

Be prepared to provide your new company with the documentation of prior payment.</p>
