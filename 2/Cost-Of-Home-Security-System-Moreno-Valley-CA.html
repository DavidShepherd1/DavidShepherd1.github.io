Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>Cameras that record big areas of the public are broad in scope, taping whatever and everyone within their reach. These cameras record everybody equally: the general public tackling their everyday activities, and wrongdoers who likely shield or mix themselves in to avoid being tape-recorded or discovered.
