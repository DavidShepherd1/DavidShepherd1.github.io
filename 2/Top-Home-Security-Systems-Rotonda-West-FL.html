<p>At night, though it lacks the complete IR LED selection of some rivals, the Arlo catches enough light to see a good distance, and there's an adjustable spotlight offered if you're positioning it outdoors - which nicely brings us to the fantastic motion detection.

Those are different solutions with various requirements and goals.</p>
