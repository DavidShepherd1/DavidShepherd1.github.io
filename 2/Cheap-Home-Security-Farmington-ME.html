<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, since it is rather connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi.
