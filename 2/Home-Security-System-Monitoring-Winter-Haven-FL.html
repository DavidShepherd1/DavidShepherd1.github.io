<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
