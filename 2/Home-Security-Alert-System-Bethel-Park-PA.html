You could spend a similar amount for the best home security system, but they do not monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Sentinel. But, they're the best home security cameras if you're trying to find active monitoring. One essential exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 each month, which could be a budget friendly choice for customers in backwoods.

For beginners, it looks lovely: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily similar to the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey).
