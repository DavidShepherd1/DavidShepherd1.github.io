<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
