I put this wireless CCTV camera type top of the list merely because if you don't know it, you will lose huge. Intelligent technology knows the difference. With smart sensors, you and your family pet can remain safeguarded without worry of false alarms. It is much better to have a separate computer system (server) for submitting video to the cloud.

<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the center) is $399, and additional cameras are $299 each.
