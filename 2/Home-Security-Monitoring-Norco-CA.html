<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the exact very same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical existing to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
