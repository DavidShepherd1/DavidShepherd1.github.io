<p>Unlike traditional alarm systems, which have a control panel (usually located in the entryway hall) that is utilized to deactivate the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensing units have actually been activated, clever alarms are controlled from a smart device app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you've currently left home, and informs you if any of the sensors have actually been activated, rather than getting home to discover your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially annoying your neighbours). Nevertheless, clever alarms do need a hub that enables the different components to wirelessly link. However for most smart alarms this hub can be put anywhere in your home.</p>

The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
