<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts each time you stroll by.
