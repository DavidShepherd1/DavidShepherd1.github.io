<p>Thanks to current improvements in technology, wireless security systems are now as efficient as wired systems If you've decided to install a burglar alarm, you must think about the following benefits of wireless innovation. For some, that might deserve the $300 price. But while we like the smart functions and home automation compatibility of the Nest Web cam IQ, a number of the cameras we took a look at offer the very same benefits at a more reasonable price.

With the capability to zoom in and out without forfeiting its focus.

<p>A system that needs a contract might be a clever choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?
