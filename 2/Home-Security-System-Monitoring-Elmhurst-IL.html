Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
