Just a couple years back, the home security industry was dominated by a couple of big names providing pricey, rigid plans with little versatility and hostile, long-lasting contracts. Systems were limited to a couple wired motion sensors connected to a keypad control panel and go through a landline. Nowadays, this has all changed.</p>

<p>Your place and potential risks will determine whether hidden or noticeable cameras are ideal for you. If you're worried about your cameras being handicapped, you may want to conceal them. A mix of both can often be a good plan, too. Wireless security systems are a great method to go, particularly due to the fact that they are so versatile compared to a hard-wired system. Nevertheless, there are a couple of things you need to understand before you go out and buy one.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>

A personal hidden camera constructed into a watch or pen might be a good alternative if you need to document an important conference in a public place. Lastly, if you just wish to see what your employees are up to when you aren't close by, a hidden camera linked to a CCTV camera system might be the very best choice.</p>
