<h2>Home Security Camera Systems For Home Protection Centereach</h2>
<p>Consider it in this manner, if a decent still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more advanced video camera be cost the low cost of forty dollars?

<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our testing-- during the day and at night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the picture quality based on offered bandwidth, which could change throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>

<p>We like that the Argus 2 features a color night vision option, however the black and white variation can really be clearer and give you higher-quality video. This isn't really a huge offer thinking about the Argus 2's price and all its other functions-- but for the record, stick with white and black.

<p>Unlike other home security providers, Armorax has you buy equipment yourself, instead of rent it. You can pick from the choices available including 2GIG control panels, outdoor and indoor cameras, clever locks, and so on at differing cost, or simply shell out $649 for a basic system. The hardware comes with a 3-5 year service warranty and a $199 installation cost. The level of alternatives, in addition to the option of locking in to the pay-as-you-go alternative or a three-year agreement, makes Armorax a terrific option for property owners who want a higher level of choice making in their home security solution.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
