How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their latest software application and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't state which gadget was the first, and the last to fall, though.</p>

IP cameras can also be linked to what is referred to as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends out data from the camera and provides power to it.

<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals each time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
