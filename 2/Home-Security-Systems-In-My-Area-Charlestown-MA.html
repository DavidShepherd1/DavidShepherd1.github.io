For several years, Macs were thought to be unsusceptible to infections and were hardly ever targeted by cybercriminals because they represented such a small portion of the personal computing world compared to countless Windows users.

Sophos Home takes the stress out of security with automated updates, powerful Mac antivirus, and real-time protection from the latest malware and ransomware attacks.
