<p>Most modern-day CCTV video surveillance systems integrate DVRs (digital video recorders) which make it possible for operators to reap a few of the advantages of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs transform the analog video footage to digital, which helps to extend storage capacity, makes it much easier to search archived footage, and also enables users to stream video over a network for remote viewing from several areas. Typically, the mere presence of security cameras can scare away less-motivated trespassers.
