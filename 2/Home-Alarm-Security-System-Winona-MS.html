<p>As you start looking for a house alarm company, there are a number of things you need to watch out for. When you're dealing with companies who install proprietary systems and claim that they just work with their certified monitoring systems, continue with caution.

<p>For smart home features, we recommend the ADT Pulse plan. It provides full IFTTT (If This Then That) technology to let you from another location arm and disarm your system, turn lights and other electronics on and off, and manage the thermostat so you never ever have to come home to a cold house. ADT also deals with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa so you can control your security system with your voice. 10,000 careful people with mobile phones is better security than one security person seeing 10,000 people on CCTV.</p>

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
