<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
