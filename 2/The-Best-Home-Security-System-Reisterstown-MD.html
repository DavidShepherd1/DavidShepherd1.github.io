<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
