The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
