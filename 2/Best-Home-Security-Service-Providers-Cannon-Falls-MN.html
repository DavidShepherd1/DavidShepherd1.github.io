IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR.

There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
